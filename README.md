**Summary:**

To analyze performance analysis, I have chosen the Canadian superstore from Tableau website at [Source](https://community.tableau.com/)


This is a Canadian Superstore sales dataset where I will need to analyze the sales data and prepare a Dashboard. So, this project will help to the upper management so they can track metrics look at-a- glance view of current status of the sales in this Superstore.
The dataset has 8400 rows and 21 features for analysis.  

I will be comparing the performance of the Stores in many ways for the 2009-2012 to determine which Store aspects is the best performer.
I will be using various techniques and methodology taught during this course to perform analysis on selected dataset.

The dataset attributes have following information:

Row ID	Order ID	Order Date	Order Priority	Order Quantity	Sales	Discount
Ship Mode	Profit	Unit Price	Shipping Cost	Customer Name	Province	Region
Customer Segment	Product Category	Product Sub-Category	Product Name Product	Container	Product Base Margin	Ship Date
